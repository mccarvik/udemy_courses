# 
# Many trading algorithms have the following structure:
# 
# 1. For each asset in a known (large) set, compute N scalar values for the asset based on a trailing window of data.
# 2. Select a smaller tradeable set of assets based on the values computed in (1).
# 3. Calculate desired portfolio weights on the set of assets selected in (2).
# 4. Place orders to move the algorithmâ€™s current portfolio allocations to the desired weights computed in (3).
# 
# There are several technical challenges with doing this robustly. These include:
# 
# * efficiently querying large sets of assets
# * performing computations on large sets of assets
# * handling adjustments (splits and dividends)
# * asset delistings
# 
# Pipeline exists to solve these challenges by providing a uniform API for expressing computations on a diverse collection of datasets.

# ## Factors
# A factor is a function from an asset and a moment in time to a numerical value.
# 
# A simple example of a factor is the most recent price of a security. Given a security and a specific point in time, the most recent price is a number. Another example is the 10-day average trading volume of a security. Factors are most commonly used to assign values to securities which can then be used in a number of ways. A factor can be used in each of the following procedures:
# * computing target weights
# * generating alpha signal
# * constructing other, more complex factors
# * constructing filters

# ## Filters
# A filter is a function from an asset and a moment in time to a boolean.
# An example of a filter is a function indicating whether a security's price is below $10. Given a security and a point in time, this evaluates to either True or False. Filters are most commonly used for describing sets of assets to include or exclude for some particular purpose.

# ## Classifiers
# A classifier is a function from an asset and a moment in time to a categorical output.
# More specifically, a classifier produces a string or an int that doesn't represent a numerical value (e.g. an integer label such as a sector code). Classifiers are most commonly used for grouping assets for complex transformations on Factor outputs. An example of a classifier is the exchange on which an asset is currently being traded.

# # Masking
# 
# Sometimes we want to ignore certain assets when computing pipeline expresssions. There are two common cases where ignoring assets is useful:
# * We want to compute an expression that's computationally expensive, and we know we only care about results for certain assets.
# * We want to compute an expression that performs comparisons between assets, but we only want those comparisons to be performed against a subset of all assets.
