# try 'yahoo' if Google doesn't work. make sure to check the website mentioned above
# search QA forums if you have any issues on this, many questions have already been answered there!

# The Options class allows the download of options data from Google Finance.

# The get_options_data method downloads options data for specified expiry date and provides a formatted DataFrame with a hierarchical index, so its easy to get to the specific option you want.
# 
# Available expiry dates can be accessed from the expiry_dates property.

from pandas_datareader.data import Options
# fb_options = Options('FB', 'yahoo')
# everything deprecated as well
# data = fb_options.get_options_data(expiry=fb_options.expiry_dates[0])
# print(data.head())
