# # NumPy Exercises 
# 
# Now that we've learned about NumPy let's test your knowledge. We'll start off with a few simple tasks, and then you'll be asked some more complicated questions.

# #### Import NumPy as np

# In[1]:





# #### Create an array of 10 zeros 

# In[2]:





# #### Create an array of 10 ones

# In[3]:





# #### Create an array of 10 fives

# In[4]:





# #### Create an array of the integers from 10 to 50

# In[5]:





# #### Create an array of all the even integers from 10 to 50

# In[6]:





# #### Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 8

# In[7]:





# #### Create a 3x3 identity matrix

# In[8]:





# #### Use NumPy to generate a random number between 0 and 1

# In[15]:





# #### Use NumPy to generate an array of 25 random numbers sampled from a standard normal distribution

# In[33]:





# #### Create the following matrix:

# In[35]:





# #### Create an array of 20 linearly spaced points between 0 and 1:

# In[36]:





# ## Numpy Indexing and Selection
# 
# Now you will be given a few matrices, and be asked to replicate the resulting matrix outputs:

# In[38]:


mat = np.arange(1,26).reshape(5,5)
mat


# In[39]:


# WRITE CODE HERE THAT REPRODUCES THE OUTPUT OF THE CELL BELOW
# BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN THE CELL BELOW, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T
# BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT ANY MORE


# In[40]:





# In[29]:


# WRITE CODE HERE THAT REPRODUCES THE OUTPUT OF THE CELL BELOW
# BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN THE CELL BELOW, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T
# BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT ANY MORE


# In[41]:





# In[30]:


# WRITE CODE HERE THAT REPRODUCES THE OUTPUT OF THE CELL BELOW
# BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN THE CELL BELOW, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T
# BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT ANY MORE


# In[42]:





# In[31]:


# WRITE CODE HERE THAT REPRODUCES THE OUTPUT OF THE CELL BELOW
# BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN THE CELL BELOW, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T
# BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT ANY MORE


# In[46]:





# In[32]:


# WRITE CODE HERE THAT REPRODUCES THE OUTPUT OF THE CELL BELOW
# BE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN THE CELL BELOW, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T
# BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT ANY MORE


# In[49]:





# ### Now do the following

# #### Get the sum of all the values in mat

# In[50]:





# #### Get the standard deviation of the values in mat

# In[51]:





# #### Get the sum of all the columns in mat

# In[53]:





# # Great Job!
